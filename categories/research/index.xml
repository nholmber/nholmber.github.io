      <description>&lt;p&gt;The arrival of a new batch of freshmen is a sure sign of autumn and the start of a new academic semester. I am thrilled to announce that this semester should also be my last one as a Ph.D. candidate because I officially submitted my dissertation for preliminary examination last week. In this post, I will look back on summer 2018 and recap the research projects that I completed during that time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
