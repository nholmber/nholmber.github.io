      <title>Matrix diagonalization in parallel computing: Benchmarking ELPA against ScaLAPACK</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matrix diagonalization is a fundamental linear algebra operation with a wide range of applications in scientific and other fields of computing. At the same time, it is also one of the most expensive operations with a formal &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_mathematical_operations&#34;&gt;computational complexity&lt;/a&gt; of $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$, which can become a significant performance bottleneck as the size of the system grows. In this post, I will introduce the canonical algorithm for diagonalizing matrices in parallel computing to set the scene for today&amp;rsquo;s main topic: improving diagonalization performance. With the help of benchmark calculations, I will then demonstrate how a clever mathematical library choice can easily reduce the time needed to diagonalize a matrix by at least 50 %.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://nholmber.github.io/2017/05/mpi-io-cube/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I discussed the benefits of using the message passing interface (MPI) to parse large data files in parallel over multiple processors. In today&amp;rsquo;s post, I will demonstrate how MPI I/O operations can be further accelerated by introducing the concept of hints. The second topic I will discuss is the emergence of solid-state drives in high-performance computing systems to resolve I/O bottlenecks. These topics will be illustrated by benchmark calculations using a parallel writer routine that I will implement to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nholmber.github.io/2017/05/mpi-io-cube/&#34;&gt;task described previously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Parallelizing I/O operations with MPI: A case study with volumetric data</title>
      <link>https://nholmber.github.io/2017/05/mpi-io-cube/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, parsing volumetric data from large (&amp;gt; 300 MB) text files has been a computational bottleneck in my simulations. Because I expect to be processing hundreds of these files, I decided to parallelize the parser routine by leveraging the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface&#34;&gt;message passing interface&lt;/a&gt; (MPI). I will describe my first experience with MPI I/O in this post by going through the synthesis process of the parallelized parser routine. I will also examine the performance of the parallel parser.&lt;/p&gt;
